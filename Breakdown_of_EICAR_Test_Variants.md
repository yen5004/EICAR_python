Breakdown of the EICAR Test Variants


üß± 1. Basic Python Dropper
``` python
EICAR_STRING = "X5O!...$H+H*"
with open("eicar.com", "w") as f:
    f.write(EICAR_STRING)
```

- What it does: Writes the known EICAR test string to disk (eicar.com).
- Purpose: Static AV signature test.
- Detection chance: 100% if AV is active.

---

üßÖ 2. Obfuscated Dropper
``` python
encoded = "Base64_EICAR_String"
decoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode('ascii')
with open("eicar_obf.com", "w") as f:
    f.write(decoded)
```
- What it does: Hides the EICAR string in Base64, decodes it at runtime.
- Purpose: Simulates basic payload encoding like malware often uses.
- Detection chance: Lower unless AV/EDR inspects script behavior.

---

1_In-Memory_EICAR.py
``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# In-memory EICAR simulation (no shell, no disk)
# Prints the EICAR test string to stdout, without writing to disk.

from io import BytesIO

# EICAR string
eicar = b"X5O!P%@AP[4\\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*"

# Write to an in-memory buffer
mem_buffer = BytesIO()
mem_buffer.write(eicar)

# Seek to beginning if needed
mem_buffer.seek(0)

# Read it back
data = mem_buffer.read()
print("In-memory EICAR data loaded:", data.decode())

```
- Does not write to disk
- Does not call subprocesses
- Only manipulates EICAR entirely in memory
- Final result is printed to stdout

‚úÖ Will This Trigger Antivirus?
| Detection Mechanism | Will It Trigger? | Explanation |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------|
| File-based scanning | ‚ùå No | Nothing is written to disk, so classic AV scanners don‚Äôt see a file to scan. |
| Memory scanning |	‚ö†Ô∏è Rarely | Only some advanced AV/EDR tools scan Python process memory for known signatures like EICAR. |
| String detection | ‚ùå No	| The string is printed to stdout, which most AVs do not monitor in real-time. |
| Behavioral detection |‚ö†Ô∏è Very unlikely | Only the most aggressive EDR solutions might flag the presence of the EICAR string in memory or logs. |

üìà How might it trigger AV?
While most off-the-shelf AVs will ignore this script, a few scenarios could trigger detection in enterprise environments:

üü° Possible Triggers:
| Scenario | Risk | Explanation |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Advanced EDR memory scan | Medium‚ÄìLow | Some EDRs (like CrowdStrike, Defender ATP, etc.) inspect user-space memory and command-line args. |
| Centralized log monitoring | Low | If stdout is logged to SIEMs and string matching is done post-log, it might be flagged. |
| Correlated behavior | Very Low | If this is run alongside other suspicious behavior, EDR may correlate and raise suspicion. |

üõ°Ô∏è AV Detection Likelihood by Tool Type
Tool Type	Detection Likelihood	Notes
Free AV (Defender, Avast)	‚ùå Very unlikely	Will not detect this unless the string is written to disk.
Paid AV Suites	‚ùå Unlikely	May log the string in telemetry but won‚Äôt trigger alerts.
EDR/XDR (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Defender for Endpoint)	‚ö†Ô∏è Low‚ÄìMedium	Detection is possible via memory inspection, telemetry analysis, or behavior modeling.
Sandbox AV	‚ö†Ô∏è Low	May log string use, but without a file drop or shell activity, usually not flagged.

üîê Security Summary
Risk Category	Status
Malicious behavior	‚ùå None (no system changes, no persistence, no network)
Malicious payload	‚úÖ EICAR (benign but signature known)
Evasion technique	‚úÖ Yes (runs purely in-memory)
Detection likelihood	‚ö†Ô∏è Low (unless monitored memory or stdout logging)

‚úÖ TL;DR ‚Äì Will It Be Detected?
‚úÖ/‚ùå	Summary
‚ùå	Most antivirus solutions will not detect this script.
‚ö†Ô∏è	Enterprise EDRs might detect it if they scan memory or correlate stdout logs.
‚úÖ	Writing the EICAR string to a file or subprocess is almost guaranteed to trigger AV.
```





üß† 3. In-Memory Execution
A. subprocess with echo
``` python
cmd = f'echo {eicar}'
subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True)
```
- What it does: Uses system shell to echo the EICAR string.
- Purpose: Mimics droppers that execute payloads in memory or with LOLBins (Living Off the Land Binaries).
- Detection chance: Medium to high, depending on AV script monitoring.

 ---

B. tempfile with auto-deletion 
``` python
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(...) as tmp:
    tmp.write(eicar.encode())
os.remove(tmp.name)
```
- What it does: Creates a temp file, writes the string, deletes it quickly.
- Purpose: Simulates malware that cleans up after itself.
- Detection chance: Depends on AV reaction time.

---

C. PowerShell Injection
``` python
powershell_cmd = '$e="..."; [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes($e) | Out-Null'
subprocess.run(["powershell", "-Command", powershell_cmd])
```
- What it does: Runs PowerShell to generate EICAR in memory.
- Purpose: Simulates real-world fileless malware or script-based attacks.
- Detection chance: Very high for good EDRs.

ü™§ 1. Excel VBA Macro ‚Üí Python Dropper
- This simulates phishing or initial access where:
- A malicious Excel document has a macro (VBA script).
- The macro launches Python to execute a payload (e.g., an EICAR dropper).
``` vba
Sub AutoOpen()
    Dim pyCommand As String
    pyCommand = "cmd.exe /c python -c ""import base64;exec(base64.b64decode('aW1wb3J0IHdpcnRlOyB3aXJ0ZSgiWDVPKVB...==' ))"""
    
    Shell pyCommand, vbHide
End Sub
```
- What it does:
    - AutoOpen runs when the document is opened.
    - It constructs a command to run python -c <payload>.
    - The Python payload is Base64-encoded for obfuscation.
- What the Python does: Writes or generates the EICAR string.

---

üì¶ 2. Embedded Python Payload
Here‚Äôs what the payload might do before it‚Äôs base64-encoded:
``` python
import base64

eicar = base64.b64decode("WDVPKVB...").decode()
with open("eicar.com", "w") as f:
    f.write(eicar)
```
Then you Base64-encode this whole Python snippet and embed it into the VBA macro.
You can encode it like this from your terminal:
``` bash
echo "import base64; eicar=base64.b64decode('...'); open('eicar.com','w').write(eicar)" | base64
```
Use the output in the VBA code.

üß† Why This Is Useful (and Dangerous)
Feature	                        Use Case
Mimics real malware delivery	Macros calling external scripts is a classic attack chain.
Bypasses static detection	    If AV only scans static VBA, this may get missed.
Tests macro policies	        Useful for seeing if macro-blocking policies (e.g., in MS Defender) work.
Simulates phishing vectors	    This mimics malware in malicious attachments.

üõë Precautions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never test this outside of isolated, controlled lab environments.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Excel must have macros enabled ‚Äî modern Office versions block unsigned macros by default.
- ‚úÖ Use AppLocker, WDAC, and macro policies in enterprise environments to block this vector.
